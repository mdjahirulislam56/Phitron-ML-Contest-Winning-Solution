## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the solution that secured **1st Place** in the private contest: **Phitron ML Contest 01** hosted on Kaggle. The challenge focused on predicting the age of crabs based on physical measurements such as length, diameter, height, and weight components.

My approach utilized a **CatBoostRegressor** integrated into a Scikit-Learn pipeline, emphasizing robust feature engineering to capture non-linear geometric relationships.

## 🏆 Achievement
**Rank:** 1st Place

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. Feature Engineering
A custom `FeatureEngineer` class was developed to generate domain-specific features, which was a key factor in the model's performance:
* **Geometric Features:** Calculated `Volume`, `Surface_Area`, `L2_Dim` (Euclidean magnitude), and `Flatness` (Height/Length ratio).
* **Weight Decomposition:** Derived `Water_Weight` (Total Weight - Component Weights) and `Density`.
* **Ratios:** Created relative metrics like `Meat_Ratio`, `Shell_Ratio`, and `Shell_to_Body` ratio.
* **Transformations:** Applied `log1p` transformations to all weight variables to reduce skewness.

### 2. Preprocessing
* **Categorical:** One-Hot Encoding for the `Sex` feature.
* **Numerical:** RobustScaler was used to handle outliers in physical dimensions.

### 3. Model Configuration
The final model was a **CatBoostRegressor** with the following hyperparameters:
* **Loss Function:** MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* **Iterations:** 800
* **Depth:** 7
* **Learning Rate:** 0.02
* **Regularization:** L2 Leaf Reg = 10

### 4. Validation
* **Strategy:** 5-Fold Cross-Validation with shuffling.
* **Inference:** Final predictions were generated by averaging the outputs from all 5 folds and rounding to the nearest integer.
